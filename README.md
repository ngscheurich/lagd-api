# LAGD Website Core + Web API

2018 was a great inaugural year for the [Louisiana Game Developers group
(LAGD)](https://www.lagd.network/). We’ve hosted multiple meetups as well as
[Post-Pixel](https://www.post-pixel.com/), an interactive art showcase. Most
importantly we’ve created an inclusive space dedicated to our mission: fostering
and promoting the game development community in Louisiana. As we move into the
new year, I hope to grow LAGD even more, and would like to expand the
capabilities of our current website to help support that effort. This is part of
that website, and includes the core logic of the application as well as a
GraphQL web API.

## Roadmap
